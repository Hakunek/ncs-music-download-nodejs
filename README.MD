# Yeah, ik that this is a little(very) messed up, but still useful at least for me ðŸ˜„

default config leads to this playlist:
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UU_aEa8K-EOJ3D6gOs7HcyNg>
as it contains all videos from [NoCopyrightSounds](https://www.youtube.com/c/NoCopyrightSounds) channel which I really like and like music they share
filters in files [metadata-changer-master.js](https://github.com/Hakunek/ncs-music-download-nodejs/blob/main/metadata-changer-master.js) and [music-ytdl.js](https://github.com/Hakunek/ncs-music-download-nodejs/blob/main/music-ytdl.js)

the idea behind appeared to me as I do not have unlimited internet connection and playing music from youtube used up quite a lot of my internet
and that's how this appeared...
in [download.bat](https://github.com/Hakunek/ncs-music-download-nodejs/blob/main/download.bat) there is mpv used as I use this on my pc and then sync music to my phones
